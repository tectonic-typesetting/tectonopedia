\Entry{pedia@maybeEmit}{\string\pedia@maybeEmit}{\pedia@@maybeEmit}
\DeclareTerm*{\string\pedia@maybeEmit}{@Bpedia@@maybeEmit}

The internal Tectonopedia command \b{\string\pedia@maybeEmit} will cause a
\`@BtduxEmit` command to happen if the conditional \`@Bif@@pedia@@emitNeeded` is
true. It is intended to be used at the beginning of commands like \`@BEntry` to
ensure that \`@BtduxEmit` is invoked between outputs.


\Entry{if@pedia@emitNeeded}{\string\if@pedia@emitNeeded}{\if@pedia@emitNeeded}
\DeclareTerm*{\string\if@pedia@emitNeeded}{@Bif@@pedia@@emitNeeded}

A \TeX\ conditional indicating whether an output has been started, such that we
should call \`@BtduxEmit` before starting a new output or before finishing
processing the current file.

As with standard \TeX\ conditional processing, the commands
\tex`\@pedia@emitNeededtrue` and \tex`\@pedia@emitNeededfalse` are
automatically defined to set the condition to true and false, respectively.
