\Entry{dump}{\string\dump}{@Bdump}

The \TeX\ \`primitive` \tex`\dump` finishes processing of a \`format` definition
session.

The \tex`\dump` primitive behaves essentially like \`the @Bend primitive` (which
is not to be confused with the \LaTeX\ command of the same name). However, it
may only be used in “initex” mode to generate a \`format file`. At the end of
such a session, \TeX\ emits a format file rather than a standard XDV file.
Another difference is that \tex`\dump` may not be invoked in the middle of a
group.
