\entry{dump}{\string\dump}{\dump}

The \TeX\ primitive \tex`\dump` finishes processing of a \e{format} definition
session.

The \tex`\dump` primitive behaves essentially like \e{end} (which is not to be
confused with the \LaTeX\ command of the same name). However, it may only be
used in “initex” mode to generate a \e{format-file}. At the end of such a session,
\TeX\ emits a format file rather than a standard XDV file. Another difference is
that \tex`\dump` may not be invoked in the middle of a group.
