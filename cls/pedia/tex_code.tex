% TeX code examples. One day we'll have syntax highlighting, cross-referencing,
% and all sorts of good stuff ... but not yet.
%
% \tex renders inline TeX code processed in a "verbatim"
%   mode. Right now it's just an alias for the fancyvrb
%   \Verb command, but we want a separate command that
%   specifically indicates that its contents are TeX
%   because in the future we might include syntax
%   highlighting, hyperlinking, etc.
\let\tex=\Verb
