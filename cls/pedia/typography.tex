% The zero-sized hspaces here address an issue that I don't understand where the
% reference point of the canvas is messed up if one of these macros appears at
% the beginning of a paragraph, causing the word "TeX" (etc.) to appear in the
% wrong location. This presumably has something to do with how the \special gets
% positioned at the very start of a paragraph but I haven't looked into it in
% detail. The \hspace solution is lame, but so far seems effective.
